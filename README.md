## What is this?
This is a repository of some of the resources that I used that helped me learn, understand, and master Javascript. Below, I listed a table of contents in which I detail all the different concepts I learned from each of resource. I have also linked them here for your use in case you need a refresher, want to learn JS, or just wanna check it out. I will be updating this from time-to-time whenever I discover a new tool that helped me understand certain Javascript concepts. I hope this repository is helpful to you too, dear reader!

### Cool Tools
1. RegExr: I'll be honest, RegExp is not my favorite and is definitely something I need a refresher on from time to time. Though FCC's course included a unit on Regular Expressions, for some reason, I had trouble retaining the information so I searched for a tool that made it easier and simpler to learn and understand it. I am pleased to announce I found a super cool one called [RegExr](https://regexr.com/), made by Grant Skinner (check out his repo [here](https://github.com/gskinner/regexr/))! I strongly advise you all to check this out!

### My Favorite YouTubers
Being a visual and neurotic learner, I find video lectures and tutorials to be very effective in learning. I have listed all of my favorite YouTubers below who helped me hone in on certain concepts around which I had trouble wrapping my head.
